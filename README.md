# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. In order to accomplish this, I needed to use flexbox, grid, and media queries. External fonts were also used so those had to be implemented using CSS. This is a social media inspired website with a profile, images, descriptions, and buttons. The website is designed so it works seemlessly on computers, tablets, and mobile devices.
